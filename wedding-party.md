We're so excited that you will be in our wedding! Here's what you need to know:

## Is there a rehearsal?
We are not having a rehearsal, so we will distribute instructions (if any) beforehand. We are looking to hire a wedding coordinator to handle things the day of, at both the church ceremony and brewery reception, so if we do assign you a task it will likely just be a small thing


## No rehearsal?!
Yeah, some things are probably going to be a bit chaotic but our philosophy is to relax and embrace it :) 

## Dress code
We are not coordinating outfits, we want you to wear something that makes you feel great in. We're shooting for cocktail party. 

For those wearing suits, hem those pants. No tie necessary. 
(Elliot is not wearing a traditional suit.)

Closer to the date, we will ask if you prefer to wear a boutonni√®re or hold a bouquet. 

If not having a dress code is stressing you out, pick something that might work with the wedding colours! We also have a [really good photographer](https://www.instagram.com/fernariellephoto) coming so it's up to you if you want to go all out. 

## Wedding theme
The wedding theme is ART. 

Here's the colour palette:

which is based on Hockney's flowers:

We will be in Toronto Friday to Monday. We _may_ organize a meetup for close friends and family on Saturday evening at The Annex Hotel's wine bar. This is optional. 

## The day of (Sunday)

We have not decided whether we will provide hair & makeup for the wedding party.
