    <h3 id="how-we-met">How we met</h3>
<p>We had our first date on November 6th 2020 at Miss Bao in between lockdowns. Over drinks (Tom Yam Siam for her, Rum and Smoke for him), we hit it off over:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Economics &amp; parenting (Emily Oster)</li>
  <li>Tech bro health optimisation trends (very 2020)
    <ul>
      <li>Andrea had asked: What <em>is</em> a tech bro?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Infovores</li>
</ul>

<p>(Elliot was unfortunately still growing out his blond tips (if you must, the pic he took before his first date is <a href="/assets/img/blond-elliot.jpg">here</a>). Fortunately, Andrea was not deterred and he successfully asked her out on a second date.)</p>

<p>We dated and became official shortly after Christmas 2020. Since we were in lockdown again, I would visit with Andrea at her place on the days she didn’t have Forrest. Although he wasn’t there, I was intrigued by his art. This one remains my favourite from those early dating days:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/forrest-art.JPG" alt="image" />
<em>Artist: Forrest</em></p>

<p>What is it? We still do not know.</p>

<p>Andrea had mentioned to her son that she had spent some time with her new friend Elliot. Forrest then declared, “I think I should meet Elliot too.”</p>

<p>And that’s how a few weeks later that winter, I met Forrest for the first time. I was very nervous! When I rang the buzzer, a tiny 5 year old kid with the biggest smile opened their apartment door, and in his excitement to open the main door for me, he missed a step running down the stairs, tripped, and exploded into tears. I felt so bad.</p>

<p>It was not very fortuitous. But after some hugs from his mom, he approached me to play together.</p>

<p>We spent the rest of 2021 in and out of lockdown. When the schools closed, I headed over to Andrea’s to help with online school and everything else that comes with balancing work and family. As the saying goes, the days were long but the year was short.</p>

<p>On our first Christmas together in 2021, we went skating by City Hall. I wanted to take a picture of Andrea and Forrest, and a kind stranger offered to instead take a picture of the three of us together. Forrest jumped up and put both his arms around us.</p>

<em>Post-skating by City Hall, 2021</em></p>

<p>Let’s fast forward through many wonderful dates and getaways. In September 2022, we went away on our first big trip together: a week in the south of France (and 24 hours in Paris)! Andrea wanted to swim in the Mediterranean, make perfumes in Grasse, and see her first castle. I wanted to dress up, see my first David Hockney exhibition, and go to a Michelin starred restaurant. We did it all – except for the castle, but more on that later.</p>

<em>Grasse, France, September 2022</em></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/michelin.JPG" alt="image" />
<em>Pure &amp; V (1-star), Nice</em></p>

<p>Very shortly after, I left for graduate school in the UK. Having spent so much time together each day, it was tough being apart for 8 months. We planned to have Andrea visit in February 2023. When I saw her exit Heathrow, we had the biggest smiles.</p>

<p>Our first meal out was at Bancone in SoHo. 
<img src="/assets/img/bancone.JPG" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The next 7 days were pretty whirlwind. I wanted Andrea to have the best first trip to London. We went to the V&amp;A, the British Museum, and Andrea geeked out at the Tower of London. I also wanted her to visit the LSE campus and see where I spent most of my days stressed out over readings and deadlines.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/london.JPG" alt="image" />
<em>Obligatory tourist photo at LSE in front of the upside down globe</em></p>

<p>Remember the missed opportunity to see a castle in France? We had a second chance now and took a train out of London for a special treat, an overnight stay at Hever Castle, which was Anne Boleyn’s childhood home (King Henry VIII visited once!). There was a lovely BNB attached.</p>

<p>The next morning, we woke up early to stroll the grounds before it opened to visitors for the day. We took photos of the beautiful castle and the many gardens. I set up a tripod to have it timed to take a shot of us. As I went to join her, I turned her towards me instead and went down on one knee…</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/proposal.jpg" alt="proposal" />
<em>She said yes at Hever Castle</em></p>

<p>Readers may be shaking their heads to learn that I actually proposed with a dummy ring. I had ordered the ring ahead of time but hadn’t factored in the UK’s postal strikes. As soon as I realised the ring would arrive 1 day after we left for the castle, I asked my housemates to find me a stand-in as I would not have been able to sneak away for a quick shop while sightseeing with Andrea.</p>

<p>When we left the castle for London, we went straight to the jeweller to pick up the ring. And here she is:</p>

<em>A Toi et Moi cut to symbolise us</em></p>

<p>I’m very lucky to have found Andrea and Forrest. They have the biggest hearts and I hope you will come celebrate with us at our wedding!</p>
