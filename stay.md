As Toronto is a large city with lots of options, we will provide some reccomended places that hopefully work for all budgets and travel itineraries. All prices are of Nov 11 2022.

**Note for international visitors:** May 19th 2024 is a Sunday of a Canadian long weekend (Victoria Day). Prices are typically high for this weekend when booking last minute, so we recommend booking your accomondation as soon as you have confirmed your attendance. (We've booked ours!)

(Will continue updating this page as we find more options)

### Hotels (\$\$-\$\$\$)

[InterContinental Toronto Centre, an IHG Hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dRXf3eAdJLt7hrpG8): 225 Front St W, Toronto, ON M5V 2X3

[Chelsea Hotel](https://www.chelseatoronto.com/)
33 Gerrard St W, Toronto, ON M5G 1Z4
* Very close to the church ceremony, and right in downtown Toronto

[Marriott Downtown at CF Toronto Eaton Centre](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/yyzec-marriott-downtown-at-cf-toronto-eaton-centre/overview/?scid=f2ae0541-1279-4f24-b197-a979c79310b0)
525 Bay St., Toronto, ON M5G 2L2
* Also very close to the church ceremony

### Boutique hotels (\$\$-\$\$\$)
Toronto has lots of great little boutique hotels (note: some of these places are age 21 and up). For those looking to splurge, these are some of our favourites for short getaways:
* [The Annex Hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QxZPGYpracFRnZ6j7) (very reasonably priced for the long weekend)
* [The Drake](https://maps.app.goo.gl/inAq4EkRoA3DGLio9) (Queen St. West)

We haven't tried these yet but have only heard good things:
* [Gladstone](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jcqrxWGvq8iJccU48)

### AirBnBs (\$\$-\$\$\$)
We'll focus our suggestions here by neighbourhoods closest to the reception as you will likely have better options outside of downtown Toronto:
* High Park/Keele: might catch cherry blossom season, close to the reception brewery
* The Annex: Koreatown, great food, cafes, and bookstores
* Dundas West: very underrated, for the adventurous
* Runnymede/High Park North/Junction: quieter, more suburban options

This might be a riskier option as provincial/city governments have been doing unpredictable things to reduce AirBnBs lately. 

### Massey College Residence ($)
Massey College is a graduate-student only residence that opens its rooms for public rentals each summer ([Summer Residence Program](https://www.masseycollege.ca/summer-residence-programme/)). I (Elliot) had a really lovely stay there last summer and would recommend it to anyone who wants to be very centrally located in Toronto for the lowest possible price. Because it is a student residence, they don't charge tax!

Pros: Clean, cosy, historic architecture, breakfast is included and in the most beautiful dining room, walking distance to the best bits of Toronto(Kensington Market, Chinatown, Yonge/Bloor, the Annex)

Cons: Less private (shared single bathrooms), bookings are taken by email request only closer to May
