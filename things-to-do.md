Things to do in Toronto, and Canada!

## Toronto 
This is our suggested itinerary for visiting Toronto, with a heavy emphasis on great food, cafes, and art. We've organised it by neighbourhood because the the best way to explore the city is to walk through each neighbourhood, and May is a beautiful month for exploring Toronto:

**Dundas St West towards Trinity Bellwoods**

[Stephen Bulger Gallery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wHk7akrWJykfFPfD8) - photography plus cool related books (free)

[Milou](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mWH8ygPEqLJ6wcZN9) - French bistro 

[Hanmoto](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jiDziJWEjjrT3kSq5) - izakaya

[Guu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hCXtn5hFWp3AmWDB8) - another great izakaya that's a lot of fun, multiple locations

[Saving Grace](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BHWeiEG19T5oMdFB7) - Elliot's favourite breakfast place (a local favourite & gets busy fast)

**Once youâ€™re at DSW and Ossington, head south of Ossington:**

[Bellwoods Brewery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HTKMYrHvB1HsQGPz5) - great, hoppy, craft beer

[Bang Bang Ice Cream](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HzdKMEiib4pJviGW8) - inventive, never disappoints

[Pho Tien Thanh](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RpyxAfkmmRLJGB7u7) - cheap pho, lots of character

**Once you hit Ossington & Queen St West, head east towards Trinity Bellwoods**

Lots of cafes along here

[Type Books](https://maps.app.goo.gl/brGvzLgYat4jyRR58) - great bookstore

As you keep walking down QSW, you will hit lots of other interesting shops

**The best parts of Toronto are Chinatown & Koreatown**

**Koreatown**

[Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ft4v19HMuqC3NyQXA) - lots of great Korean options on this street but this is the OG

[BMV Books](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JdVNET1VZDSJv7bw6) - probably the bookstore to visit when in Toronto, discounted new titles, huge

[Hodo Kwaja](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WFt2qQfFhhiqGTwZA) - Korean bakery, great to bring some snacks home

**_Chinatown_**

[Yin Ji Chang Fen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rRpxYYWSvDaPviFD9) - best dim sum, known for their range of rice rolls which is unusual for a dim sum place. Get the HK milk tea. Also very affordable

[Juicy Dumpling](https://maps.app.goo.gl/621e4PpGgZoRgJad8) - get your xiao long bao fix here, as good as Din Tai Fung's but at a fraction of the price. A great pitstop while exploring Chinatown/Kensington Market

[House of Gourmet](https://maps.app.goo.gl/T4uENPbZrGBVC7bf8) - good for variety of Chinese food, there are other similar spots like King Noodle but this is a favourite. Insane portions

[Art Gallery of Ontario](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ksM4YAx6uY6CVA1j8): huge Canadian collection, plus others. [OCAD U](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6ENwwJPX5YFXPyk78) is right behind it and the campus is worth a peek at 

**_Kensington Market (next door to Chinatown)_**

[FIKA cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yCrDUxCHxNeCK8dj9) - Swedish, has a cat

[Kid Icarus](https://maps.app.goo.gl/J77Xp1KbZ2VgfLw36) - always worth popping into for cute things

[Seven Lives](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ovaDX39FWP4XUHBz6) - all the rage for tacos 

[Little Pebbles](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UVwXDMHH1EUEmaKB9) - really really nice Japanese cafe

Nearby on College St.

[Pomegranate](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vyDu38MYejztic92A) - very, very good Persian food

[Manic Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/M7xsVyCEZwfnjrD78) - next door and another undergrad favourite spot


## Canada

There are two possible routes to see the rest of Canada:

### 1. Go east:

Take the Via Rail train from Toronto to Montreal (~5 hours). You can make stops along the way in Kingston (come say hi!) or Ottawa (our capital).

If you're planning to visit Montreal too, ask us for a suggested itinerary!

Our suggestion...
* Make a day trip to Niagara Falls on Saturday or Monday. You can take the GO train there and back 
* And go east:
    - Drive 2.5 hours to Prince Edward County: it's got amazing wineries where you can get flights with cheese curds (Sandbanks, Norman Hardie), craft breweries (Slake), lavender fields, local art scene, boutique hotels, the best Italian cafe (Piccolina Mercato)
    - Stop by Kingston for a visit :) Our downtown waterfront is a treat, you can easily spend the day enjoying the gorgeous Queen's campus in the summer 
    - Continue on to Ottawa, our capital, for a walk through Parliament Hill, Byward Market, several national museums
    - End your trip in Montreal for a taste of francophone Canada (best neighbourhood: Mile End for the bagels, coffee,little stores, South East Asian ice cream, general good vibes)

### 2. Fly west
Fly out of Pearson to Alberta to see Lake Louise, Banff, and the Rockies.

Or head to BC to see Vancouver, Whistler, Vancouver Island (Victoria, Tofino).
