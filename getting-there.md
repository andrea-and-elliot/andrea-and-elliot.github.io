## Overview
The wedding will be held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It will follow in two parts:
* 2PM: Church ceremony at First Lutheran Evangelical Church
* 5:30PM: Reception dinner & dance at Rainhard Brewery

The ceremony and reception are located about 30 minutes apart by car or 1 hour by transit. 

## Getting to Toronto
For international visitors, the best airport to fly into is Pearson (YYZ). There is a direct train from Pearson that goes downtown in about 25 minutes (~$12 CAD one way): [UP Express](https://www.upexpress.com/en). 

For those driving in from elsewhere in Ontario, the church ceremony is located at the heart of downtown Toronto -- TMU's campus (formerly Ryerson University). It is steps away from the Eaton Centre. 

## Getting to the ceremony
First Lutheran Evangelical Church is located at: 116 Bond St, Toronto, ON M5B 1X8

As the church is located on a university campus in downtown Toronto, finding parking may be very challenging and costly. There are many transit options -- the nearest TTC stop is Dundas station. 

## Getting to the reception
Rainhard Brewing is located at: 100 Symes Rd, Toronto, ON M6N 0A8

The brewery is located in the Stockyards. If you find yourself wondering if you're lost as you head there because it's a little industrial, you're probably in the right place!

If you are coming from the church ceremony without a car, we recommend either:
* Share an Uber/Lyft/cab with others to head directly to the reception
* Take the TTC subway from Dundas to Keele station, then take a bus or Uber (8 minutes) to the brewery

If you are only attending the reception and driving in, the brewery has ample free parking (60 lots).
