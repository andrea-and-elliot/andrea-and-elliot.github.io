## When should I RSVP by?
We would love to know by February 1st 2024. We will send reminders after the New Year. 

## What time should I arrive at the ceremony?
We encourage guests to arrive 30 minutes before the ceremony at 2pm. Whether you are driving into Toronto or taking the TTC, Toronto traffic and parking can be challenging so plan for extra time to find parking or for transit delays. 

## Are kids welcome?
Yes!!!! We have fun surprises planned for the kids, and we can't wait to see their dance moves! 

## Is there a dress code?
The dress code is cocktail, and both the ceremony and reception will be held indoors. Since Canadian weather can be unpredictable in May, we will do our best to make things comfortable for our guests. If it is cold, there will be heating. If we get very warm weather, there will be AC. 

## Is there a wedding theme?
Yes! Thanks for asking :) While this is currently still being workshopped, the following motifs will be present:
- chaos
- calm
- [David Hockney's flower series](https://www.artsy.net/artist-series/david-hockney-flowers)
- existential thoughts about true love
- rollicking good times
- shapes & colour Ã  la [Micah Lexier](https://www.instagram.com/micahlexier/) and [Agnes Martin](http://thisistomorrow.info/articles/agnes-martin)

## Are you registered? Where?
We are fortunate to be covered in the household items department, so we are forgoing a registry. If you wish to give a gift, we would prefer contributions to either our honeymoon fund or help with a downpayment on our future house!

## Can I bring a date?
Please restrict the attendees in your party to only those listed on your invitation. We wish we could accommodate all our friends and family, but we have to respect the venue limits. We hope that we are able to celebrate with others at a later date!

## What's the parking situation?
**Church ceremony:** as the church is located on a university campus in downtown Toronto, finding parking may be very challenging and costly. Since the ceremony is on a Sunday afternoon, you may be able to find paid parking on adjacent streets. 

There are many transit options -- the nearest TTC stop is Dundas station. We also recommend using taxis/Ubers/Lyfts between venues. 

**Rainhard Brewery:** free, unlimited parking on the property. 

## I have a food allergy, can I make a special request?
Please let us know of any food allergies in your RSVP on our website.

## What can I do between the ceremony and reception?
We estimate that the ceremony will end by 3-3:30pm, which gives 1.5-2 hours before the reception doors are open. 

Travel to Rainhard Brewery may take 30 minutes by car (longer by transit). 

The Eaton Centre is a 10 minute walk away if you would like to have a quick window shop!
